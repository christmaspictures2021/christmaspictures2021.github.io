    <p>Thanks to meghan markle and prince harry&#039;s wedding and the gorgeousness of william and kate&#039;s kids, it&#039;s easy to become obsessed with the royal family&#039;s comings and goings. The windsors have a penchant for giving each other cheeky gifts to celebrate the holiday, because, when you already own the crown jewels, the next most priceless thing is a laugh. They follow this tradition instead of opening gifts on christmas morning because king george (queen elizabeth ii’s father) was of german descent.
